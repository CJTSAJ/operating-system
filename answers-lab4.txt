1.Compare kern/mpentry.S side by side with boot/boot.S. 
Bearing in mind that kern/mpentry.S is compiled and linked to run above KERNBASE just like everything else in the kernel, 
what is the purpose of macro MPBOOTPHYS? Why is it necessary in kern/mpentry.S but not in boot/boot.S? 
In other words, what could go wrong if it were omitted in kern/mpentry.S? 
Hint: recall the differences between the link address and the load address that we have discussed in Lab 1.
答：因为mpentry.S里的地址被链接成高地址，但是启动其他cpu的时候，这些cpu还未启动保护模式以及地址翻译，
因此需要一个宏MPBOOTPHYS来翻译地址。

2.It seems that using the big kernel lock guarantees that only one CPU can run the kernel code at a time. 
Why do we still need separate kernel stacks for each CPU? 
Describe a scenario in which using a shared kernel stack will go wrong, even with the protection of the big kernel lock.
答：在trap或者中断时，cpu会在栈上Push一个trapframe结构，这是硬件操作，无法加锁，如果所有cpu使用同一个栈，可能会造成覆盖。

3.In your implementation of env_run() you should have called lcr3(). 
Before and after the call to lcr3(), your code makes references (at least it should) to the variable e, 
the argument to env_run. Upon loading the %cr3 register, the addressing context used by the MMU is instantly changed. 
But a virtual address (namely e) has meaning relative to a given address context--the address context specifies the physical address to which the virtual address maps. 
Why can the pointer e be dereferenced both before and after the addressing switch?
答：e是envs数组中的一个元素，envs在kern_pgdir初始化，之后每隔env初始化时都会复制kern_pgdir的UTOP以上地址。所以e可以在任何env中解引用。

4.Whenever the kernel switches from one environment to another, it must ensure the old environment's registers are saved so they can be restored properly later. 
Why? Where does this happen?
答：保存好寄存器，switch之后，再运行该env才能恢复到上次运行的状态以便继续运行；调用trap前，会执行_alltraps汇编来保存trapframe。
